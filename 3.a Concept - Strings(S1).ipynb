    "# Introduction:\n",
    "# This lesson covers essential concepts in Python strings, \n",
    "# including string immutability, formatting, regular expressions, and string operations.\n",
    "# We will also explore practical examples and challenges with complete solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- 1. String Immutability and Copying Strings ---\n",
    "# Strings in Python are immutable, meaning once created, their content cannot be changed.\n",
    "# Attempting to modify a string directly will cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of an immutable string:\n",
    "original = \"Hello\"\n",
    "# Uncommenting the line below will raise an error because strings are immutable.\n",
    "# original[0] = 'Y'  # This will raise an error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instead, to \"modify\" a string, we must create a new one.\n",
    "new_string = \"Y\" + original[1:]\n",
    "print(new_string)  # Output: Yello\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "# 1. Strings are immutable in Python.\n",
    "# 2. If you need to modify a string, Python creates a new string instead of altering the original.\n",
    "# 3. In this example, we replaced the first character with 'Y'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- 2. Advanced String Formatting with f-strings (Python 3.6+) ---\n",
    "# f-strings allow easy and efficient string formatting by embedding variables and expressions directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 30\n",
    "height = 1.75\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using f-strings for string formatting\n",
    "print(f\"{name} is {age} years old and {height:.2f} meters tall.\")\n",
    "# Output: Alice is 30 years old and 1.75 meters tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "# f-strings can also contain expressions inside the string\n",
    "print(f\"In 5 years, {name} will be {age + 5} years old.\")\n",
    "# Output: In 5 years, Alice will be 35 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "# 1. f-strings are the most modern and fastest way to format strings in Python.\n",
    "# 2. They are convenient for embedding variables and expressions inside strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- 3. Regular Expressions for Powerful String Matching ---\n",
    "# Regular expressions are a powerful tool for finding patterns in strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Searching for an email in a string\n",
    "text = \"Please contact us at support@example.com for assistance.\"\n",
    "email_pattern = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\n",

    "if email:\n",

    "# 1. Regular expressions are useful for text pattern matching.\n",
    "# 2. They allow for complex search operations, like finding all occurrences of email addresses in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- 4. Unicode and String Encoding ---\n",
    "# Python strings are Unicode by default, meaning they can represent international characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: String in Greek\n",
    "greek_hello = \"Γειά σου Κόσμε\"  # \"Hello World\" in Greek\n",
    "print(greek_hello)  # Output: Γειά σου Κόσμε\n",

    "# Encoding a string to bytes (UTF-8 encoding)\n",
    "encoded_string = greek_hello.encode('utf-8')\n",
    "print(encoded_string)  # Output: b'\\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb5\\xce\\xb9\\xce\\xac ...'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decoding the bytes back into a string\n",
    "decoded_string = encoded_string.decode('utf-8')\n",
    "print(decoded_string)  # Output: Γειά σου Κόσμε\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "# 1. Unicode allows Python to support characters from any language.\n",
    "# 2. Encoding is important when you need to handle byte data (for instance, when working with files or networking).\n",
    "# 3. The string is encoded into UTF-8 and then decoded back into its original form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- 5. Memory Efficiency with String Operations ---\n",
    "# When handling large-scale data, understanding the memory efficiency of string operations can greatly improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Efficient string concatenation using join\n",
    "words = [\"Python\", \"is\", \"fast\", \"and\", \"fun\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inefficient way (bad practice)\n",
    "sentence = \"\"\n",

    "    sentence += word + \" \"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient way (good practice)\n",
    "sentence = \" \".join(words)\n",
    "print(sentence)  # Output: Python is fast and fun\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "# 1. Using `+=` for string concatenation in a loop is inefficient as it creates a new string on every iteration.\n",
    "# 2. Using `\" \".join()` is much more efficient for joining strings, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
